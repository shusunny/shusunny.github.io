# My personal homepage 

This is my personal blog using [Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll), a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

My old blog is made with Hexo and Nodejs which is not easy to change the article and manage. You can view my new blog at [Sunny Blog](https://shusunny.github.io/)

这里是我的个人主页，用github page搭建，网址在[Sunny的博客](https://shusunny.github.io/)

# Vno - Jekyll

[Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno), which is originally developed from [Dale Anthony's Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno).
